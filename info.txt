🛠️ Phase 1: Install Core Development Tools
Your laptop needs two main tools: Git (to download the code) and Python (to run the code).

1. Install Git
Git is the software that handles version control and allows you to download the repository.

Action: Go to the official Git website and download the installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

Installation: Run the installer. You can usually accept the default settings throughout the process.

2. Install Python
Python is the programming language the chatbot is written in.

Action: Go to the official Python website and download the latest stable version (e.g., Python 3.11 or newer).

Installation (Crucial Step): When running the installer, ensure you check the box that says "Add python.exe to PATH" before clicking "Install Now." This allows you to run Python commands from any terminal window.

3. Verify Installations
Open your terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, or macOS Terminal) and run these commands to ensure everything is ready:

Bash

# Verify Git
git --version
# Verify Python
python --version
Both commands should return version numbers.

💻 Phase 2: Get the Code and Configure the Environment
Now we'll download the project and install all the libraries it needs.

4. Clone the Repository
Use the link you were given to download the entire project directory.

Bash

# Replace <YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK> with the link you have
git clone <YOUR_REPOSITORY_LINK>

# Change into the project directory (e.g., chatbot_project)
cd chatbot_project
5. Create a Virtual Environment
This step is essential to keep the project's many dependencies (like PyTorch and Gemini SDK) isolated from other projects.

Platform	Command to Create	Command to Activate
Windows	python -m venv venv	.\venv\Scripts\activate
macOS/Linux	python3 -m venv venv	source venv/bin/activate

Export to Sheets

You should see (venv) appear at the start of your terminal prompt, indicating the environment is active.

6. Install Project Dependencies
The requirements.txt file lists all the necessary Python libraries.

Bash

# Install all libraries needed for the chatbot (Gemini, Hugging Face, etc.)
pip install -r requirements.txt
🔒 Phase 3: Set Up the Secret Key
You need your personal Gemini API key to allow the bot to generate responses.

7. Obtain and Prepare the API Key
Action: Generate your own Gemini API Key from the Google AI Studio dashboard.

Action: In the project folder, you should find an example file (e.g., .env_example). Make a copy of it and name the copy .env.

8. Insert Your Key Securely
Action: Open the new .env file in a text editor (like Notepad, VS Code, or Sublime Text).

Action: Paste your unique key into the designated variable:

# .env file content
GEMINI_API_KEY="AIzaSy...your_personal_key_here...xYZ"
(The project uses the python-dotenv library to read this key securely at runtime.)

🚀 Phase 4: Run the Chatbot
9. Launch the Application
With the environment active and the key set, you can now run the main script.

Bash

# Run the chatbot program
python main.py
The chatbot should initialize the models and prompt you with the welcome message, ready for conversation!
